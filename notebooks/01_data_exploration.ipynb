    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "We're working with 27,632 animals from Jacksonville Humane Society between January 2021 and December 2023. Most are cats (16,903) with fewer dogs (10,729), which is pretty typical for shelter populations. The data includes everything we need: species, breeds, colors, ages, sex, how they came in, and what happened to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning the data was straightforward. We dropped some unnecessary columns like secondary colors and patterns, removed 5 incomplete records, and standardized the color names since there were 42 different ways to describe essentially the same colors. For example, \"Brown,\" \"Chocolate,\" and \"Mahogany\" all got grouped together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sex distribution is interesting. Overall there are slightly more males (52%) than females (48%), but this varies by species. Dogs skew heavily male (55.6% vs 44.3%), while cats are almost perfectly split. Only 10 animals had unknown sex recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is this is high-quality data. Almost 95% of animals were adopted, there's virtually no missing information, and we have plenty of animals in each color category for meaningful statistical comparisons. The data has been split into separate cat and dog files for the statistical analysis."
